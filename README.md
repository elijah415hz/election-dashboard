## Why is this important?
We are fast approaching a major election in the United States. Currently less than 2/3 of eligible citizens are registered to vote, and of those most know very little about most of the officials that they'll be voting on in November. Election Dashboard aims to be an easy place for voters to quickly get information about who their officials are, how to contact them, and if they've been in the news.
